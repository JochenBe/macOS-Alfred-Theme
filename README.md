## Installation

1. Download `macOS.alfredappearance` and `macOS Dark.alfredappearence` from the latest release or directly from the repository
2. Open both files and import the appearances into Alfred 4

### Recommended Appearance Options

For an even better macOS look and feel, set the following appearance options:

- Enable `Hide hat on Alfred window`
- Enable `Hide result shortcuts`
- Set `Show result subtext` to `Only for Alternative Actions` or `Never`
- Set `Show scroll indicator` to `Automatically`
- Enable `Auto highlight top result`
- Enable `Use native macOS Dark Mode window rendering`

## Automatically switching between the macOS and macOS Dark appearance

1. Under the **General** tab in **System Preferences** set `Appearance` to `Light`
2. In the **Alfred 4 Appearance settings** select the `macOS` theme
3. Under the **General** tab in **System Preferences** set `Appearance` to `Dark`
4. Now select the `macOS Dark` theme in the **Alfred 4 Appearance settings**

Alfred will now automatically switch between the `macOS` and `macOS Dark` appearance based on the current system appearance.
